# React + TypeScript + Vite + Vitest

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR, path aliases, testing, automation and some ESLint rules.

## .env Files

```bash
.env                 # loaded in all cases
.env.local           # loaded in all cases, ignored by git
.env.[mode]          # only loaded in specified mode
.env.[mode].local    # only loaded in specified mode, ignored by git
```

Sample added - needs to be converted to be ignored
